Remarks: 
-All the points are generated randomly. Therefore, in some cases, the curve will fit much better than some other cases. In case, the error in fit is very high, re-run the code right from the start. 
-Sometimes, overflow error might occur depending on the compiler. In that case, reduce the learning rate and increase number of epochs.
